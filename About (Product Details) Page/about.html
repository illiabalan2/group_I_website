            <h2>About the Innovation</h2>
            <p>We have developed AI-powered streetlights that adjust the brightness of their LEDs dynamically based on human and/or vehicular detection. Each streetlight includes a camera and an AI model that is built in to the product and can also detect and track movement while also filtering out irrelevant triggers like birds or other small animals/distractions. The lights also have the ability to tilt, this is to follow individuals or vehicles more efficently and accurately. This ensures visibility while aslo minimizing our energy waste. In large crowds, they will remain stationary but can also increase brightness strategically to reduce any unnecessary light pollution.</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI-Powered Precision:</strong> Only detects relevant objects to minimize any false activations.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Axis Movement:</strong> Lights will tilt to have a seamless experience for the user.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptive Brightness:</strong> Adjusts light intensity based on traffic and pedestrians.</li>
                <li><strong>Light Pollution Reduction:</strong> Dims when no movement is detected. This reduces power consumption and light pollution</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Urban Integration:</strong> It is fully autonomous and helps to enhance smart city initiatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> The footage is not recorded and is only used to process in real time.
                </li>
