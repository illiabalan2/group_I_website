    <!-- General Description Section -->
    <section class="content">
        <p>
            Our idea is AI-powered streetlights that dynamically adjust their brightness based on human or vehicular presence. Using energy-efficient LEDs, each light is equipped with an embedded camera and AI model capable of detecting and tracking people and vehicles in real time, while ignoring irrelevant motion like birds or stray animals.
        </p>
        <p>
            When movement is detected, the light slightly brightens and smoothly tilts along its vertical axis to follow the subject. In higher foot or vehicle traffic, brightness increases to enhance visibility. However, in the presence of larger crowds, the lights remain stationary and simply brighten to reduce disorientation and minimize unnecessary light pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
            This system helps cities reduce energy consumption, improve public safety, and tackle the growing issue of light pollution. It also offers configurable detection settings, enabling municipalities to fine-tune sensitivity toward pedestrians, vehicles, or cyclists depending on local needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Importantly, all AI processing is done locally on the device—no data is stored or transmitted—ensuring full privacy and compliance with data protection regulations. Adaptive Lights represent the future of sustainable, intelligent urban infrastructure.
