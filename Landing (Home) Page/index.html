        <h1>Welcome to Adaptive Lights</h1>
        <p>Our Idea is AI-powered streetlights that use LED lights dynamically to adjust brightness based on human/vehicular presence. Each streetlight has an inbuilt camera with an AI model that can accurately detect and track humans/vehicles while ignoring other types of movement e.g. birds or foxes on streets. When a person or vehicle passes by, the light slightly brightens and follows them by skewing on its vertical axis. If more people are present, the brightness increases accordingly. However, in large crowds, the lights remain stationary and only brighten to reduce unnecessary light pollution in the area. Light Pollution is a growing issue in more urban areas and can affect quality of health drastically. The AI would be configurable to specific needs, whether that be to be tuned to react to cars, humans or cyclists. The AI also does not store or transmit any footage and only processes the data.
